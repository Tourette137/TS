# Run the program  
In order to run the program, you must in the first place use the command **make** to compile the program ao create the executable.

In order to register the user in our program it is:

    ./our_passthrough register

In order to run the program in a certain folder to make a mnt/, it is, for example:

    ./our_passthrough pastaTestes

Then you can test it by opening a file, like:

    cat pastaTestes/<full path to test file>

If you don't want to test the programm no more, and not leave it on the background, you can run the command **make clean**.
